## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#When considering Real Estate a first impulse is to consider the three rules of Real Estate, Location, Location, Location. These rules seem to be useful when considering the listings that sold Above Median Price. As evidenced in the chart below, certain neighborhoods were almost sold above Median with certainty. Some of these neighborhoods were Gilbert, Somerset, Northridge Heights, Stone Brook, Bloomington Heights, Greens, Clear Creek, Timberland and Veenker. Other neighborhoods were 70% or higher Above Median such as Northwest Ames, Sawyer West and Crawford, while some stood out for their high likelihood to be Below the Median price such as North Ames, Sawyer, Old Town, Brookside, Rail Road and Edwards
